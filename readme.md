Hey Everyone! This is a risk of rain web app that I created from the API I made earlier. I fell in love with game when my brother in-law gave me his copy for the Nintendo Switch. I love these kinds of games and it doesn't stop me from being all-powerful! 

I have noticed that video game console players are lagging behind with the resources to hel them. Whether it is quality of life mods, charactermods, etc. console always gets left behind. I'm hoping that with this it can help people out with their runs and character stat tracking. I want everyone to try and bring everyone up on the same level!

This application will allow my console only homies to figure out their stats on their runs!
This application will eventually;



--Some optimizations I would add if I had more time on this project.--

1. Have the survivors with a toggle level up. This way you can figure out the base stats of your survivor at any level.

2. Be able to add items to your survivor for each play through will have. Want to have 400 crowbars to see how much damage you would do? Now you can!

3. Keep a environment log to track what spawns where, and where secret items will be found.
